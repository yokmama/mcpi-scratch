MCPI-Scratch
================

A ScratchX extension application for the Minecraft Pi Protocol

# Introduction
MCPI-Scratch lets you write Scratch scripts to manipulate Minecraft. 

More specifically, its an extension application for the [ScratchX editor](http://scratchx.org/) that allows you to use blocks that represent the [Minecraft Pi Protocol](http://wiki.vg/Minecraft_Pi_Protocol) API. It actually uses a slightly cut-down version of the API specified by the [RaspberryJuice](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/raspberryjuice/) mod which allows it to connect to both:
* Minecraft Pi Edition
* CraftBukkit server with the RaspberryJuice mod

A more detailed description is provided in [github page for the project](http://yokmama.github.io/mcpi-scratch/)
